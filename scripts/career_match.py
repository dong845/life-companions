"""
career_match.py — honest interest/values/traits -> occupation congruence.

Computes how well a person's self-reported profile (a transparent RIASEC INTEREST
CHECK, plus optional Work Values and a light Big Five read) matches O*NET
occupations shipped in data/career/occupations.json. It emits COARSE BANDS
(Low / Moderate / Strong) with a CONFIDENCE NOTE — never a fabricated percentage,
salary, demand, or percentile. Raw floats are used only for internal ranking and
are kept OUT of the person-facing payload.

Design honesty rules baked in:
  * The person-side items are an interest CHECK grounded in Holland/RIASEC, NOT
    the O*NET Interest Profiler or any validated instrument (see assessment_items.json).
  * Occupations whose interest signal comes only from a 3-letter high-point code
    (riasec == null) are expanded with a coarse 3-2-1 rule and flagged
    lower-confidence. Since the O*NET 31.0 rebuild the shipped data has none.
  * All magic numbers (weights, band thresholds, the 3-2-1 expansion) are the
    disclosed constants below — auditable and tunable.

Pure standard library (no numpy) so it runs offline anywhere, matching the rest
of this skill's scripts; the linear algebra is trivial on 6-vectors.
