trends.py — aggregate the journal index into gentle, factual trends.

Reads journal/index.jsonl (one JSON object per entry) and reports mood average,
current logging streak, recurring tags/themes and recent mood direction. These
are DESCRIPTIVE facts about what the user wrote — not predictions and not
judgments. "Streaks" are surfaced without guilt (a gap is just a gap).

Usage:
  python3 trends.py [--home ~/.companion] [--days 30]
